You probably remember May 2018. The frantic policy updates. The cookie consent banners appearing on every website. The sudden realization that "we should probably do something about this" had come too late.

GDPR changed how businesses handle data. The Digital Product Passport is about to change how businesses handle products. And the pattern looks remarkably familiar.

## The Pattern We've Seen Before

EU regulations follow a predictable trajectory. Years of vague discussions. Gradual policy refinement that most businesses ignore. Then sudden enforcement deadlines that trigger industrywide panic.

GDPR followed this path. The regulation was adopted in 2016, but most companies didn't take it seriously until months before the May 2018 deadline.

DPP is following the same curve right now. The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation entered into force in July 2024. Delegated acts defining specific requirements are being adopted through 2027 and 2028. Most businesses are still in the "this probably won't affect us" phase.

It will.

## Where GDPR and DPP Compare

- **Both affect your entire value chain** — GDPR made you responsible for how suppliers handled data. DPP does the same for product information.
- **Both require infrastructure, not just policies** — You couldn't solve GDPR with a privacy policy alone. DPP requires similar investment in product data systems.
- **Both have extraterritorial reach** — GDPR applies to any company processing EU residents' data. DPP applies to any product placed on the EU market, regardless of where manufactured.
- **Both touch every department** — GDPR affected marketing, sales, HR, and customer service. DPP requires coordination between product development, supply chain, compliance, and commercial teams.

## Where DPP Is Different

GDPR was about **restricting access** to information — limit what you collect, protect what you store, delete what you don't need. DPP **inverts this logic** — the goal is to expose information, making product data transparent and accessible.

GDPR could largely be solved with documents and digital workflows. DPP requires integration with physical products — every regulated item needs a data carrier (QR code, NFC chip, RFID tag) linked to a digital record. This is operational infrastructure, not documentation.

## Why SMBs Should Pay Attention

A survey of European small businesses found that over half spent between €1,000 and €50,000 on GDPR compliance. Research analyzing firm performance across 61 countries found that GDPR's negative impact on profits was twice as severe for small technology companies compared to the average, while large platforms saw no significant negative effects.

DPP risks repeating this pattern. Small and medium businesses face the same requirements with a fraction of the resources.

## What to Do Differently This Time

**Start before requirements are finalized.** The general framework is clear. Waiting for every delegated act means starting when competitors are finishing.

**Choose tools over consultants.** The better investment is in systems that generate ongoing value: platforms that manage product data, automate passport creation, and integrate with existing workflows.

**Build infrastructure that serves your business, not just regulators.** The discipline required for DPP compliance — organizing product data, tracing supply chains, documenting materials — is the same discipline that makes businesses run better.

## The Window Is Open

The next two years will determine which companies lead and which scramble to catch up. If you learned anything from GDPR, it's that early preparation beats last-minute panic.

DPP is your second chance to get this right.
