## What DPP Means for Developers & Tech Teams

Digital Product Passports are reshaping product data management and regulatory compliance. As a developer, IT architect, or CTO, you're tasked with integrating diverse data sources, enabling secure data exchange, and ensuring smooth public and internal access — all while keeping systems scalable and maintainable.

The DPP mandate introduces new complexity: evolving standards, interoperability challenges, and the demand for real-time, verifiable data across distributed supply chains.

## Technical Challenges

- **Fragmented and Heterogeneous Data** — Multiple product data sources, formats, and standards
- **Evolving Regulations** — Constant updates requiring adaptable implementations
- **Performance & Security Demands** — Public product data access must be fast, reliable, and secure globally
- **Avoiding Vendor Lock-In** — Solutions must allow flexibility for migration, auditing, and data portability
- **Bridging Tech and Non-Tech Teams** — Translating technical requirements for compliance and business teams

## How DPPA Helps

### Flexible Data Modeling & Relations

Hierarchical product relationships — parents, children, and sibling substitutions — even across different DPP providers. Relations linked via URLs, avoiding data duplication.

### Easy Data Onboarding & Mapping

Upload spreadsheets or connect PIM systems for seamless attribute mapping and synchronization.

### Modular, API-First Platform

Built with MACH architecture — API-first, cloud-native, and extensible. Easy integration and future-proof scalability.

### Optimized Public Access Layer

Core product data embedded offline in QR/NFC codes, paired with a globally distributed, high-performance public web service.

### Robust Versioning & Exportability

All data versioned, exportable, and portable in JSON. Full control without vendor lock-in.
