## What a DPP Actually Contains

A Digital Product Passport is a structured digital record accessible via a QR code, NFC chip, or RFID tag. The EU requires this data to be machine-readable, based on open standards, and compatible with the Commission's central registry.

While specific requirements vary by product category, most DPPs need to include:

- **Product identification** — Unique identifier (ISO/IEC 15459:2015), manufacturer details, model and batch info
- **Compliance documentation** — Declaration of conformity, technical documentation, certifications, substances of concern
- **Environmental data** — Carbon footprint calculations, recycled content percentages, durability indicators
- **Lifecycle information** — Installation guidance, maintenance requirements, repair options, end-of-life handling
- **Access controls** — Different stakeholders get different levels of access (consumers vs. authorities)

## Sector-Specific Implementation

### Batteries

Battery companies face the earliest mandatory deadline: **February 18, 2027**.

**Start here:**
1. Map current data collection against required fields
2. Calculate carbon footprint per battery model and manufacturing plant
3. Establish supply chain due diligence documentation (trace cobalt, lithium, nickel)
4. Build unique identifier infrastructure — QR code linking production systems to DPP platform

### Textiles

Requirements likely mandatory around **mid-2028**, but complex global supply chains need the extra time.

**Start here:**
1. Audit supply chain visibility across all manufacturing steps and countries
2. Focus on material composition first — fiber content, country of origin, recycled content
3. Prepare for the ban on unsold goods destruction (ESPR requirement)
4. Consider labeling strategy — QR codes on care labels, NFC in hang tags, durability through washing

### Construction Products

Phased approach tied to harmonized standards updates. GWP declarations already required for certain products as of January 2026.

**Start here:**
1. Determine which of the CPR's 36 product families apply to you
2. Prioritize Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) based on EN 15804 standards
3. Align with BIM requirements for digital building project compatibility
4. Plan for **25-year data retention** requirement

## Common Implementation Mistakes

- **Treating DPP as a one-time project** — Passports require ongoing updates throughout the product lifecycle
- **Starting with technology before data** — Audit your current data landscape first before buying platforms
- **Underestimating supplier cooperation** — Begin supplier conversations early; some need significant support
- **Ignoring access control complexity** — Different data for different stakeholders is a regulatory requirement
- **Waiting for final specifications** — Core requirements are clear enough to begin now

## Practical Timeline

### Now through Q2 2026
- Conduct data gap analysis
- Establish supplier data agreements
- Select and implement a DPP platform

### Q3 2026 through Q4 2026
- Run pilot projects on a subset of products
- Train teams across procurement, manufacturing, quality, sustainability, and IT
- Validate data quality with audits

### 2027
- Battery companies go live (February)
- Textile and construction companies complete pilots
- Monitor regulatory updates and delegated acts

## Finding the Right Partner

DPP implementation is complex but doesn't require enterprise-scale budgets. At DPPA, we work hands-on with customers to implement DPP solutions that fit their operations and scale with growth. Our involvement in Standard Norway's DPP standardization committee means we track requirements at the source.
