## What DPP Means for Retailers & Importers

If you sell, distribute, or import products into the EU or EEA, the Digital Product Passport (DPP) isn't just a compliance issue for manufacturers — it directly affects you. Under ESPR and related regulations, retailers and importers will be responsible for ensuring that products on the market display and link to valid product passports.

From electronics and batteries to textiles and furniture, your role is critical in delivering transparent, accessible product data to consumers, regulators, and repair services — both online and at the point of sale.

## Common Challenges

- **Fragmented Supply Chain Data** — Difficult to verify every product from every supplier includes a valid passport
- **Expanding Legal Responsibility** — Expected to ensure DPP compliance before placing products on the EU/EEA market
- **Integration with Retail Channels** — DPPs must be reliably connected to products accessible by customers without disrupting systems
- **Limited Time to Adapt** — Enforcement timelines moving fast

## How DPPA Helps

### EU & EEA DPP-Ready From Day One

Guidance through all requirements — from ESPR to Battery Regulation — across impacted product groups. Full data ownership and no platform lock-in.

### Fast, Secure Lookups Anywhere

Each product assigned a unique QR/NFC code. Core passport data embedded in the code (offline-accessible), extended details via high-performance public lookup service.

### Connect Products Across Systems

Parent-child, sibling, or group relationships between products — including links to other DPP providers via secure URLs.

### Simple Onboarding

Pre-structured Excel template with required fields. For PIM users, guided attribute mapping and system connection support.

### Built for Scale — API Coming Soon

MACH-based architecture hosted in Microsoft Azure's EU cloud. Tenant-facing API coming soon for full system integration.

## Why It Matters

- **Build Customer Confidence** — Transparency at point of sale builds loyalty
- **Ensure Product Readiness** — Prevent non-compliant products from reaching shelves
- **Enable Circular Retail** — Passports unlock repair, trade-in, resale, and recycling models
- **Reduce Supplier Risk** — Verify compliance across your supply chain

## FAQ

**What happens if a product doesn't have a valid passport?**
You may not be legally allowed to sell or import it into the EU/EEA. DPPA helps flag these cases early.

**Can we link to supplier DPPs instead of hosting them ourselves?**
Yes — the platform supports referencing external DPPs via secure URLs, with fallback hosting options.

**Is the platform GDPR-compliant?**
Yes — zero-trust security model, all infrastructure in Azure's European data centers, data encrypted in transit and at rest.
