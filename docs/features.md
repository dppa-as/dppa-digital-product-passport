## Get Started Fast

No complex setup. No IT bottlenecks.

### Excel Import

Import your product data in bulk using a structured spreadsheet template — one row per product, with attribute guidance provided. No extra tooling or training required.

### PIM System Integration (Early Access)

If you're using a Product Information Management (PIM) system, we work closely with you to map key product attributes and establish a data connector — enabling future syncs and automation.

### QR and NFC Code Generation

As soon as your product data is validated and approved, unique codes are generated for each product. These are ready for printing, packaging, or embedding digitally.

## Built on Modern Architecture

Scalable, modular, and secure from day one.

### API-First, Modular Infrastructure

MACH-compliant platform (Modular, API-first, Cloud-native, Headless) allowing flexible integration and growth. Public APIs will be made available in future phases, with the foundation already in place.

### Enterprise-Grade Security

Hosted in Microsoft Azure with security features including Azure Front Door, Web Application Firewalls, encrypted data storage, and strict access controls. Built to support enterprise demands from day one.

### EU-Based Hosting

All data is stored exclusively in Microsoft Azure's European datacenters — ensuring GDPR compliance and full alignment with EU data sovereignty requirements.

---

## Compliant and Transparent by Design

Product data that's reliable, traceable, and always accessible.

### Scan-Based Product Access

Each QR or NFC code links directly to a publicly available product passport, accessible via a read-optimized web service. No app installation required.

### Immutable Product Versioning

Every time a product is updated or published, a new version is saved. This creates a full, timestamped history — essential for audits, traceability, and lifecycle transparency.

### Clean JSON Export

Your data remains portable. Export full product records as JSON files for backup, migration, or integration with your internal tools.

---

## Compliance Made Easy

Built around EU and EEA requirements.

### Ready for Digital Product Passport and ESPR

The platform supports core data structures and requirements of the EU Digital Product Passport framework, ESPR, Battery Regulation, and other sector-specific standards — right out of the box.

### Regulatory Updates

The system evolves alongside EU legislation. Stay ahead of compliance requirements with future-ready validation tools and schema updates.
