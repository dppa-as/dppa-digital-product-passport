## The Regulatory Landscape: What's Confirmed

The EU has moved from policy discussions to concrete legislation.

**Batteries** are first in line. The EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) mandates Digital Product Passports from **February 18, 2027** for all EV batteries, industrial batteries over 2kWh, and light transport batteries placed on the EU market. This isn't pending — it's law.

**Textiles** follow under the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR). The European Commission is expected to adopt the delegated act for apparel in late 2026 or early 2027, with DPP requirements becoming mandatory approximately 18 months later — putting us at **mid-2028**.

**Construction products** operate under their own framework. The revised Construction Products Regulation entered into force in January 2025, with most provisions applying from January 2026. GWP declarations are already required for certain products, and Member States can enforce penalties from January 2027. DPP infrastructure is expected by 2026/2027, with mandatory passports following 18 months after.

The pattern is clear: timelines aren't shifting right — they're accelerating.

## Opportunity or Compliance Burden?

Every regulation creates two types of companies: those who see it as a cost to minimize, and those who see it as a competitive advantage to capture.

Early movers in sustainability reporting have already seen the answer. Companies with robust environmental data don't just avoid penalties — they win contracts, command price premiums, and build customer loyalty that's difficult for competitors to replicate.

## What This Means for SMBs

Most DPP solutions on the market are built for enterprises with dedicated compliance teams and seven-figure budgets. Small and medium businesses face the same regulatory requirements with a fraction of the resources.

This creates both risk and opportunity. SMBs that solve the DPP challenge early will have a genuine advantage over larger, slower-moving competitors still running compliance decisions through committee.

## What to Do Now

**2026** — Systems and processes. Map data sources, identify gaps, implement technical infrastructure for product passports.

**2027** — Battery companies face first mandatory deadline. Textile and construction businesses should be running pilot projects.

**2028** — Textiles enter mandatory territory, construction products follow. DPP should be routine, not a crisis project.

## A Note on Uncertainty

Specific data requirements for some product categories are still being finalized through delegated acts. Implementation details for the EU's central DPP registry are still emerging. Timelines could shift slightly.

What won't change is the direction. The EU has committed to product transparency as a cornerstone of the Green Deal.
