## The Textile Passport

The EU's push toward sustainability is transforming how clothes are designed, sold, and managed across their entire lifecycle. From 2027 onwards, new rules under the EU's Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) will require manufacturers, importers, and brands of textile and footwear products to issue fully compliant digital passports.

The Textile Passport is a mandatory form of the EU Digital Product Passport (DPP), tailored specifically to textiles and apparel. Its purpose is to digitize essential data about each garment's composition, supply chain, environmental footprint, and circularity potential. It will be attached to every qualifying product via a scannable QR code or similar data carrier.

## Who Must Comply?

The Textile Passport is required for any product in these categories placed on the EU market:

- **Apparel and Clothing** (shirts, jeans, outerwear, etc.)
- **Textiles** (home textiles, carpets, curtains)
- **Footwear and Accessories** (shoes, bags, belts)

### Industries Impacted

- Global fashion brands and retailers
- E-commerce platforms and online marketplaces
- Luxury goods manufacturers
- Uniform and workwear suppliers
- Textile mills (spinners, weavers, dyers, finishers)
- Garment factories and assemblers
- Raw material producers (cotton farms, synthetic fiber manufacturers)
- Recyclers, sorters, and collectors of used textiles
- Second-hand, rental, and resale platforms
- Importers and distributors into the EU/EEA

## Required Information

Each textile passport must include:

1. **General Information** — Brand name, style/article number, production batch, product category
2. **Materials and Components** — Fiber composition and weight, substances of concern (REACH), raw material provenance
3. **Performance and Durability** — Color fastness, resistance to pilling, recommended number of washes, care instructions
4. **Carbon and Environmental Footprint** — Lifecycle emissions and water usage, environmental footprint label
5. **Circularity and End-of-Life** — Repairability info, disassembly instructions, sorting/disposal instructions, recycled/recyclable materials percentage
6. **Safety and Compliance** — Chemicals used, regulatory compliance labels
7. **Access and Control** — Open publicly accessible data via QR code

All data must be structured, machine-readable, and accessible digitally — no PDFs, spreadsheets, or attachments.

## Textile Passport as a Gateway to Circularity

- Boosts resale, rental, and second-hand markets
- Improves fiber-to-fiber recycling with better material traceability
- Enables due diligence audits from farm to closet
- Empowers eco-conscious consumers with transparent information
- Supports interoperable circular business models
- Creates a level playing field by rewarding sustainable practices

## Compliance Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2024–2026 | European Commission defines specific rules for textiles |
| 2026–2027 | Pilot programs launch; delegated act expected |
| **~2027–2028** | **DPPs mandatory for textile products on EU/EEA market** |

## Key Challenges

- **Data Fragmentation** — Data from fiber origin to finishing chemicals across multiple supply chain tiers
- **Supplier Reluctance** — Upstream suppliers hesitant to share proprietary data
- **Responsibility Unclear** — Who maintains the passport when a garment is resold or repurposed
- **Footprint Complexity** — Gaps in consistent environmental impact measurement
- **Lack of Interoperability** — Multiple DPP solutions without shared standards

## Why Use DPPA?

- **Compliance From Day One** — Full ESPR support aligned with current and upcoming delegated acts
- **Data Submission Made Easy** — Spreadsheets or PIM integration
- **Instant Code Generation** — Secure digital ID with offline-accessible core data
