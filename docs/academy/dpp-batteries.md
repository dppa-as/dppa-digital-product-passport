## Battery Passport Deadline: February 18, 2027

The EU's push toward sustainability is transforming how batteries are manufactured, sold, and managed across their entire lifecycle. From February 18, 2027, new rules under the EU Battery Regulation ([Regulation (EU) 2023/1542](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1542/oj/eng)) require manufacturers, importers, and distributors of certain battery types to issue fully compliant digital passports.

## What Is the Battery Passport?

The Battery Passport is a mandatory form of the EU Digital Product Passport (DPP), tailored specifically to batteries. Its purpose is to digitize essential data about each battery's composition, lifecycle, environmental footprint, and sourcing. It will be attached to every qualifying battery via a scannable QR or NFC code.

The Battery Passport is intended to:

- Improve transparency for regulators, consumers, and recyclers
- Support sustainable battery production and responsible sourcing
- Enable traceability and circular economy practices

## Who Must Comply?

The Battery Passport is required for:

- **Electric Vehicle Batteries (EVBs)**
- **Industrial batteries** with a capacity greater than 2 kWh
- **Light Means of Transport (LMT) batteries** under 25 kg (e-bikes, scooters, etc.)

These batteries must include a compliant passport if placed on the EEA market on or after February 18, 2027.

### Industries Impacted

- Electric vehicle manufacturers (cars, vans, buses, trucks)
- E-bike, e-scooter, and LMT brands
- Stationary and mobile battery storage system providers
- Cell manufacturers, module/pack assemblers
- Raw material refiners, smelters, and miners
- Battery Management System (BMS) vendors
- Recyclers, dismantlers, and logistics operators
- Importers and distributors into the EU/EEA

## Required Information

Each battery passport must include:

1. **General Information** — Manufacturer name, model ID, production batch and date, battery classification
2. **Materials and Components** — Weight and type of materials, hazardous materials, raw material provenance
3. **Performance and Durability** — Nominal and actual capacity, cycle life, state of health, internal resistance
4. **Carbon Footprint** — Total lifecycle emissions (cradle-to-gate), footprint label (2025), performance class (2026), minimum thresholds (2028+)
5. **Reusability and Recycling** — Reuse/refurbishment/repair potential, dismantling instructions, recycled/recyclable materials percentage
6. **Safety and Handling** — Safe use, transport, and disposal instructions, hazard warnings
7. **Access and Control** — Open publicly accessible data via QR/NFC, role-based access for sensitive data

All data must be structured, machine-readable, and accessible digitally.

## Compliance Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Q1 2025 | European Commission adopts technical rules for format, access, and QR/NFC interoperability |
| Q4 2025 | National regulators begin enforcement preparation |
| 2026 | Pilot programs launch |
| **February 18, 2027** | **Battery Passports mandatory for new products on EU/EEA market** |

## Key Challenges

- **Data Fragmentation** — Data from multiple supply chain tiers with different systems
- **Supplier Reluctance** — Upstream suppliers hesitant to share proprietary data
- **Responsibility Unclear** — Who maintains the passport when a battery is resold or repurposed
- **Carbon Footprint Complexity** — Gaps in consistent measurement across production and logistics
- **Lack of Interoperability** — Multiple DPP solutions emerging without shared standards

## Why Use DPPA?

- **Compliance From Day One** — Full support for EU Regulation 2023/1542, ESPR
- **Data Submission Made Easy** — Spreadsheets or PIM integration
- **Instant Code Generation** — Secure digital ID with offline-accessible core data
- **Secure and Reliable** — European Azure data centers
- **Scalable MACH Architecture** — Built for millions of passports
- **Versioned, Exportable, and Yours** — JSON export, no lock-in
- **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing** — Scales with your needs
