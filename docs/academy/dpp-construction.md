## The Construction Product Passport

The EU's push toward sustainability is transforming how construction products are designed, sold, and managed across their entire lifecycle. The Construction Product Passport is a mandatory form of the EU Digital Product Passport (DPP), tailored specifically to building materials and hardware.

Its purpose is to digitize essential data about each product's composition, supply chain, environmental footprint, and circularity potential. It will be attached to every qualifying product via a scannable QR code or similar data carrier.

## Who Must Comply?

The Construction Product Passport is required for any product in these categories placed on the EU market:

- **Building Hardware and Components** (hinges, locks, handles, fasteners, etc.)
- **Construction Materials** (steel products, insulation, fixtures, fittings)
- **Architectural Elements** (doors, windows, frames, trim)

### Industries Impacted

- Building materials manufacturers and suppliers
- Hardware retailers and distribution centers
- Specialty construction product manufacturers
- Metal fabrication facilities (forging, stamping, machining, finishing)
- Component manufacturers and assemblers
- Raw material producers (steel mills, recycled metal processors)
- Metal recyclers, salvage yards, and material recovery facilities
- Building material reuse centers
- Renovation and refurbishment service providers
- Importers and distributors into the EU/EEA

## Required Information

Each construction product passport must include:

1. **General Information** — Brand name, style/article number, production batch and date, product category
2. **Materials and Components** — Fiber composition and weight, substances of concern (REACH/RoHS), raw material provenance
3. **Performance and Durability** — Load capacity, corrosion resistance, cycle testing, expected service life, maintenance requirements
4. **Carbon and Environmental Footprint** — Lifecycle emissions and water usage, environmental footprint label
5. **Circularity and End-of-Life** — Maintenance info, disassembly instructions, salvage/disposal instructions, recycled/recyclable materials percentage
6. **Safety and Compliance** — Chemical information (coatings, treatments), regulatory compliance labels
7. **Access and Control** — Open publicly accessible data via QR code

All data must be structured, machine-readable, and accessible digitally.

## Construction Product Passport: Gateway to Circularity

- Boosts salvage, reuse, and material recovery markets
- Improves material-to-material recycling with better component traceability
- Enables due diligence audits from source material to building site
- Empowers eco-conscious buyers and contractors with transparent information
- Supports interoperable circular business models
- Can be directly connected to BIM (Building Information Modeling) systems

## Compliance Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2024–2026 | European Commission defines specific rules for construction products |
| January 2026 | GWP declarations required for certain products |
| 2026–2027 | Pilot programs launch |
| **2027+** | **DPPs mandatory for first wave of construction products on EU/EEA market** |

Note: The CPR requires passport data to remain accessible for **25 years** after a product ceases production.

## Key Challenges

- **Data Fragmentation** — Data from raw material sourcing to surface treatments across multiple supply chain tiers
- **Supplier Reluctance** — Upstream suppliers hesitant to share proprietary data
- **Responsibility Unclear** — Who maintains the passport once a product is salvaged, reused, or enters the secondary market
- **Footprint Complexity** — Gaps in consistent environmental impact measurement across global supply chains
- **Lack of Interoperability** — Multiple DPP solutions without shared standards

## Why Use DPPA?

- **Compliance From Day One** — Full support for ESPR and CPR requirements
- **Data Submission Made Easy** — Spreadsheets or PIM integration
- **Instant Code Generation** — Secure digital ID with offline-accessible core data
- **Secure and Reliable** — European Azure data centers
- **Scalable MACH Architecture** — Built for millions of passports
- **Versioned, Exportable, and Yours** — JSON export, no lock-in
- **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing** — Scales with your needs
