## What DPP Means for Manufacturers

If you're manufacturing or branding products sold in the EU or EEA markets, the Digital Product Passport (DPP) will soon become a requirement — and an opportunity. Part of the EU's Green Deal and the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR), DPPs are set to transform how product data is shared, verified, and reused across the lifecycle of every product you put on the market.

Whether you produce electronics, textiles, furniture, or consumer goods, the message is clear: you'll need structured, transparent, and lifecycle-based product data — at scale.

## Common Challenges

- **Fragmented Product Data** — Product details scattered across departments, spreadsheets, and legacy systems
- **Evolving Regulations** — The EU is moving fast, and staying current with requirements is a growing burden
- **IT System Limitations** — Traditional PIM, ERP, and PLM systems weren't designed for regulatory transparency or public access
- **Pressure to Move Fast** — Internal teams are stretched, and adding compliance feels overwhelming

## How DPPA Helps

### EU & EEA Compliance from Day One

Stay in full control of your product data — we help you structure and deliver it to meet DPP requirements. From ESPR to the Battery Regulation, our platform ensures alignment with all relevant EU and EEA rules, including Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.

### Smart Public Access

Each product is assigned a unique QR/NFC code linking to its Digital Product Passport. Essential data is embedded directly in the code itself — available even offline. For detailed information, our high-performance public service ensures fast, secure access from anywhere in the world.

### Onboarding Made Easy

Send us your data via spreadsheet or connect your PIM system — no new tools to master or complex setup required. Direct platform access for self-service management is coming soon.

### Built for Scale & Longevity

MACH-based platform, API-first and cloud-native, hosted on Microsoft Azure's EU data centers for security, performance, and compliance.

### Version Control Without Lock-In

All product data is versioned, archived, and exportable in JSON format — making audits and migrations simple and transparent.

## Why It Matters

- **Turn Transparency Into Trust** — Share where materials come from, how products are made, and how they can be reused or recycled
- **Gain Real-World Usage Insights** — Each passport scan provides anonymized analytics about when, where, and how products are accessed
- **Enable Circular Business Models** — Data transparency opens the door to repair, reuse, and resale

## FAQ

**Do we need DPPs for all products?**
Not all products are impacted yet. Regulations target specific categories first (batteries, textiles, electronics), but the framework is expanding.

**What data do we need to provide?**
Typical data includes product identifiers, material composition, carbon footprint, repairability, safety info, and recycling instructions.

**Can we connect our PIM system?**
Yes. The platform integrates with PIM systems like Akeneo, PimCore, and inRiver. You can also start with Excel-based submissions.

**Who owns the data?**
You do. We never claim ownership. Export in JSON anytime — no lock-in.
