## What DPP Means for Compliance Teams

As a compliance leader, you are at the frontline of meeting evolving EU and EEA sustainability regulations. Digital Product Passports (DPPs) represent a fundamental shift in how product data is documented, maintained, and shared — from manufacturing through end-of-life.

Whether you manage compliance for electronics, batteries, textiles, or complex consumer goods, you need a solution that makes regulatory adherence straightforward, auditable, and future-proof.

## Common Challenges

- **Complex & Evolving Regulations** — Keeping pace with the EU Green Deal, ESPR, Battery Regulation, and other frameworks across EU and EEA countries
- **Data Accuracy & Traceability** — Ensuring product data is complete, standardized, version-controlled, and fully auditable
- **Cross-Departmental Coordination** — Compliance data relies on inputs from multiple internal teams and external partners
- **Public & Regulator Access** — Product passports must be publicly accessible and secure, with access control for regulators
- **Risk of Non-Compliance** — Significant fines, reputational damage, and market access restrictions
