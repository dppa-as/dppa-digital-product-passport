## Why We Started

As EU regulations push industries toward sustainability and traceability, we saw many companies — especially product teams and developers — stuck between unclear rules, clunky systems, and growing pressure to comply.

We founded **DPPA AS** to fix that.

We're builders and problem-solvers — not salespeople or middlemen. Our goal is to make Digital Product Passport (DPP) compliance effortless, practical, and future-ready for every organization, regardless of size or complexity.

## Our Vision

A future where every product can tell its full story — transparently, securely, and sustainably.

## Our Mission

To provide the most trusted, developer-friendly platform for creating, managing, and distributing Digital Product Passports — helping businesses stay compliant, efficient, and in control of their product data.

## What We Do

DPPA is a SaaS platform that enables manufacturers, retailers, and importers to create, manage, and distribute Digital Product Passports — securely, compliantly, and at scale.

Built on modern cloud-native architecture, we bridge the gap between evolving EU regulations and real-world business workflows — with tools built for product, compliance, and tech teams alike.

Our solution supports:

- **DPP creation & publishing**
- **QR/NFC-based product data access**
- **Public lookup and data exports**
- **Future-ready architecture with API-first integration**
- **Compliance with EU regulations like ESPR, Battery Regulation, Toy Safety Regulation**, and more

Whether you manage 500 SKUs or 5 million, we help you get started fast and scale effortlessly.
